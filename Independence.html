<h2 style="color: navy;"><u>History :-</u></h2>
<p style="background: lightcyan;font-size: 20px;text-align: justify;"><b>European traders</b> had established outposts in the Indian subcontinent by the 17th century. Through overwhelming military strength, the <b>East India Company</b> fought and annexed local kingdoms and established themselves as the dominant force by the 18th century. Following the <b>Indian Rebellion of 1857</b>, the Government of India Act 1858 led the British Crown to assume direct control of India. In the decades following, civic society gradually emerged across India, most notably the <b>Indian National Congress Party</b>, formed in 1885.The period after World War I was marked by colonial reforms such as the Montaguâ€“Chelmsford Reforms, but it also witnessed the enactment of the unpopular Rowlatt Act and calls for self-rule by Indian activists. The discontent of this period crystallised into nationwide non-violent movements of non-cooperation and civil disobedience, led by <b>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.</b></p>

<h2 style="color: navy"><u>Independence Day before Independence :-</u></h2>
<p style="background: lightcyan;font-size: 20px;text-align: justify;">At the 1929 session of the <b>Indian National Congress</b>, the Purna Swaraj declaration, or "Declaration of the Independence of India" was promulgated and 26 January was declared as <b>Independence Day in 1930</b>.The Congress called on people to pledge themselves to civil disobedience and "to carry out the Congress instructions issued from time to time" until India attained complete independence.Celebration of such an <b>Independence Day</b> was envisioned to stoke nationalistic fervour among Indian citizens, and to force the British government to consider granting independence.The Congress observed 26 January as the Independence Day between 1930 and 1946.The celebration was marked by meetings where the attendants took the <b>"pledge of independence"</b>.Jawaharlal Nehru described in his autobiography that such meetings were peaceful, solemn, and "without any speeches or exhortation".Gandhi envisaged that besides the meetings, the day would be spent.</p>

<h1 style="color: navy;"><u>Partition and independence</u></h1>
<p style="font-size: 20px;background: lightcyan;text-align: justify;"><b>Millions of Muslim</b>, Sikh and Hindu refugees trekked the newly drawn borders in the months surrounding independence.In Punjab, where the borders divided the Sikh regions in halves, massive bloodshed followed; in Bengal and Bihar, where Mahatma Gandhi's presence assuaged communal tempers, the violence was mitigated. In all, between 250,000 and 1,000,000 people on both sides of the new borders died in the violence.While the entire nation was celebrating the <b>Independence Day</b>, Gandhi stayed in Calcutta in an attempt to stem the carnage.On 14 August 1947, the Independence Day of Pakistan, the new Dominion of Pakistan came into being; Muhammad Ali Jinnah was sworn in as its <b>first Governor General in Karachi</b>.

The Constituent Assembly of India met for its fifth session at 11 pm on 14 August in the Constitution Hall in New Delhi.The session was chaired by the <b>president Rajendra Prasad</b>. In this session, Jawaharlal Nehru delivered the Tryst with Destiny speech proclaiming <b>India's independence.</b><p>
